Every summer I brew up a new batch of one of my favorite styles of lagers, the
[New Zealand Pilsner](/recipes/#new-zealand-pilsner). This is my fourth version that uses
exclusively 100% Nelson Sauvin hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/kiwi-pils-v4/).

# Appearance

The beer pours a fluffy white head that has some legs and leaves some lacing. The carbonation
is lively and the bubbles are visible. Like previous batches It has a pale straw color
that nearly perfectly clear with just a hint of haze.

# Aroma

In this batch I dry hopped with 1.5oz Nelson Sauvin. The aroma on this beer is mild,
but has notes of white grape and a pleasant aroma from the Pilsner malt. It's a mix
of the two aromas and I do prefer the aroma on this batch more than [the previous version](/recipes/kiwi-pils-v3).

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The carbonation is perfect and is medium-high providing a good amount of bubbles. The
taste is really clean with the Nelson Sauvin really shining. White grape and gooseberry
are very apparent. There is just a touch of the pilsner malt flavor in the finish. I
am a big fan of the [Gold Rush Pilsner malt](http://www.goldrushmalt.com/) and will
continue to use it in future batches.

# Impressions

This is my fourth variation on the beer and through experimentation I feel like it's
pretty dialed in at this point. I may still experiment with other varieties of New
Zealand hops (paired with Nelson Sauvin of course) in the future.
