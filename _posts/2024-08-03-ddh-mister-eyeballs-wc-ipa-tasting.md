A west coast IPA with Citra, Nelson Sauvin and LUPOMAX Idaho 7 hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/mister-eyeballs-ddh-wc-ipa/).

# Appearance

At 2 weeks in the keg, the beer has a pale golden straw color. It still has a little haze, which should clear up in the keg. It pours an inch of fluffy white foam with good head retention and lacing.

# Aroma

You can smell this one from a mile away. Tons of sweet citrus and melon jump out at me. As it warms, the aroma becomes a little more intense.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer has moderate carbonation and finishes on the dry side. The taste is really enjoyable. Tangerine, white grape and citrus notes dominate. It finishes with a moderate bitterness.

# Impressions

This beer clocked in at 6.3% ABV and is super crushable. It's refreshing, hoppy and the finish begs another sip. I'm super pleased with how this one
turned out.

For the double dry hopping, I dry hopped once in the unitank right before the end of fermentation. For the 2nd dry hopping, I added them directly to the keg. Because of this I didn't carbonate the beer in the unitank, but instead burst carbonated in the keg. This method of double dry hopping worked really well and I intend to use it in the future on both west coast and hazy IPAs.
