A West Coast IPA with Mosaic, Galaxy and Strata hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/mosaic-galaxy-strata-wc-ipa/).

# Appearance

Pours a pale golden orange with a bit of haze. A creamy white head sits atop that sticks
around for awhile and leaves some legs of lacing over time.

# Aroma

I get some stone fruit, guava, mild sweetness and an overall general citrus character on the nose.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer has medium carbonation. It is very fruit forward at first followed by a small amount of
sweetness and a medium bitterness in the finish. In terms of fruit flavor I get notes
of blueberry, strawberry and general citrus flavor, like in the aroma. There is somewhat of a
hop burn in the finish.

# Impressions

This is an interesting beer. I had some problems keeping the temperature consistent during
fermentation, so it got hotter than I would have liked at peak fermentation. I go back
and forth on what I think of this beer. Sometimes I"m not a huge fan and other times
I think it's decent. I wouldn't mind brewing this again but with a more consistent
temperature during fermentation.
