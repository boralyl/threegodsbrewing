This [recipe](/recipes/hbc-586-west-coast-ipa/) uses my house IPA grain bill and was hopped exclusively with [HBC-586](https://yakimavalleyhops.com/products/hbc-586-hop-pellets) in the
boil, whirlpool and dry hop additions.

# Appearance

Pours a mostly clear, pale straw color. The beer itself is really light with a touch
of haze that will likely clear up more in the keg. I get about 1/2" of white head that
leaves decent lacing.

# Aroma

The aroma is very aromatic. It has notes of melon, citrus and subtle pineapple or some
other sweeter fruit.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer is light in body with medium carbonation. The taste is quite interesting and
has a lot various fruit characteristics I picked up in the aroma. In addition to the
melon, citrus and sweet fruit I get a touch of herbal notes. No real pine or dank flavors
from this hop.

# Impressions

This is a really nice hop variety. I'd love to pair it with something like Simcoe or
Chinook to get some pine and possibly some dank notes. I think that would play well
with the medley of fruit flavors. I'm looking forward to future IPAs with this hop variety.
