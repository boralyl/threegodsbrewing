A west coast IPA with AU Galaxy and Vic Secret hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/trip-wire-wc-ipa/).

# Appearance

Pours a light orange color with mild haze. A 1/2" of white head sits atop the beer and
leaves some decent lacing as it settles.

# Aroma

The aroma consists of orange, guava and a hint of pine.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer has a medium amount of carbonation. There is a bit of orange and more pineapple in the taste. Light notes of pine and resin along with a moderate bitterness show up in the finish.

# Impressions

This batch was my frist time trying out [Vic Secret hops](https://yakimavalleyhops.com/products/vic-secret-hop-pellets). They ended up pairing very well with Galaxy. This brew day was a disaster, so I'm pleasantly surprised that the beer actually ended up being tasty. I made a lot of mistakes in this batch, including forgetting to dump the trub, so I'm not surprised the beer wasn't crystal clear out of the gate.

As of writing, this beer has been on tap for about 3 weeks. I noticed that initially I didn't enjoy the taste, but now it's tasting much better. So perhaps it just needed a little conditioning. Will keep that in mind when sampling future batches.
