I based this [recipe](/recipes/hints-of-dank) off of [Grains of Wrath's](https://gowbeer.com) Dystopia IPA.
From the description on their website:

> Northwest IPA using Simcoe, Citra and Mosaic to bring flavors and aromas of pine and tropical fruit. 6.7% ABV

# Appearance

The beer pours with a fluffy white head with plenty of lacing. The color is a medium gold
and has a slight haze despite conditioning for a few weeks and the use of gelatin.

# Aroma

The aroma is a mix of citrus, pine and diesel. The citrus is the most subtle with the
diesel being more prominent in the tail-end of the aroma. As the name suggests, it's got
some dankness.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

There is moderate carbonation with a light body. The flavor has a touch of citrus, but
features more dank and diesel flavors. There is a mild sweetness towards the end of the
taste and it has a pleasant medium bitterness in the finish.

# Impressions

Overall I think this beer turned out pretty well. I was somewhat surprised that it did
not clear up more. While not being an exact clone of Dystopia, it definitely shares
some of the flavor profile of that beer. I plan on doing a closer clone in the future
by incorporating some Mosaic hops.

This beer is a solid west-coast IPA that I'm happy to have on tap.
