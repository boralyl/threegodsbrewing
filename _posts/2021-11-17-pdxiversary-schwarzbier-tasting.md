This [recipe](/recipes/pdxiversary-schwarzbier/) uses a hybrid lager/ale yeast ([Imperial G03 Dieter](https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/german-ale/dieter/)) that was
inspired by a [brulosophy reciepe](https://brulosophy.com/recipes/may-the-schwarzbier-with-you/).
It was fermented in th high 50's / low 60's.

# Appearance

The beer produces a fluffy tan head from the tap. The beer itself is clear, but dark.
It has a brownish-red tint to it, but you can see through it when held up to the light.
There's a little bit of lacing as the foam dies down.

# Aroma

The aroma is quite interesting. You get some cacao and coffee with just a small amount
of fruitiness. The fruitiness is likely a by-product of fermenting with a KÃ¶lsch yeast strain.
It's not overpowering at all, just slightly present in the background.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer is decievingly light in body and is has a nice crispness to it. It has a medium
amount of carbonation. As the aroma alludes, there are some cacao and coffee flavors
throughout the taste. The finish contains a whisper of the fruity esters from the yeast.

# Impressions

Despite a number of problems I had using new equipment with this batch, the end product
still turned out really well! Having a lower ABV beer that is crisp and packed with
flavor during the cooler months is a great option.
