This West Coast IPA uses the classic Citra / Simcoe hop combination along with my normal
malt bill of ~75% Pilsner and ~25% Pale Malt.

# Appearance

This beer pours mostly clear with a hint of haze. It has a straw color with orange
highlights. It pours a sticky white head that leaves plenty of lacing on the inside
of the glass.

# Aroma

The aroma is really pleasant. I get notes of pine, lime and citrus fruit. I also
pick up a tiny bit of diesel.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Light in body with a medium amount of carbonation. The taste is similar to the nose. It
starts with the pine flavor then is followed up by some subtle lime and citrus notes.
It finishes with a moderate bitterness.

# Impressions

It's been a long time since I tried out this tried and true combination of Simcoe and
Citra hops in a West Coast IPA. Citra really plays well with a lot of hop varieties and
I enjoy the melded flavor from the Simcoe.
