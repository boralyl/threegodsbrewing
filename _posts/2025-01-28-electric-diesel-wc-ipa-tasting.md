A West Coast IPA with Citra, Citra Lupomax, Nectaron and Simcoe Cryo hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/electric-diesel-west-coast-ipa/).

# Appearance

Pours a pale and somewhat cloudy straw color. You can see through it, but the clarity isn't great. It produces an inch of white fluffy head that has great retention and leaves sticky lacing as it fades.

# Aroma

The aroma is bright and tropical with plenty of citrus and pineapple.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Moderate carbonation with a crisp and dry finish. Similar to the aroma, you get the tropical fruit up front, but mid-taste you get a touch of pine. The flavors play well with one another. The finish has a small amount of bitterness, just enough to beg another sip. The bitterness is not as apparent as some recent batches, but I wouldn't consider that a negative in this particular beer.

# Impressions

This batch finished at 7.4% abv with a final gravity of 1.010. I had a lot of problems kegging this beer. I carbonated it in the unitank but when I went to do the closed transfer I ended up stirring up the remaning hops and trub. It took me several days to finally get it kegged. I think that accounts for some of the clarity issues compared to previous batches. That being said, this beer is really tasty and I'm happy with how it turned out. This was my first time trying out Nectaron and I liked how it played with Citra and Simcoe.
