This West Coast IPA uses a hop combination of Enigma, Citra, Mosaic and Nelson Sauvin
along with my normal malt bill of ~75% Pilsner and ~25% Pale Malt.

# Appearance

This beer pours mostly clear with some haze. It's not quite as clear as my last batch
of West Coast IPA, but it also has been kegged for a much shorter amount of time. I expect
it to get nearly crystal clear after another week or two conditioning in the keg.
It has a straw color with orange highlights. It pours a sticky 1/2 inch of white head
that leaves plenty of lacing on the inside of the glass.

# Aroma

The aroma has very faint notes of blueberry, white grape and pine. I'm impressed with
the aromatics, likely from the dry hop combination of Citra, Mosaic and Nelson Sauvin.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Light in body with a medium amount of carbonation. The taste has some raspberry notes in
addition to the white grape. The blueberry from the nose isn't detectable to me in the
taste. It finishes with a slightly more aggressive bitterness than my last batch of West
Coast IPA. I don't mind it at all!

# Impressions

I really enjoy the complexity of this beer. The mix of popular hop varieites from
Australia, New Zealand and the United States really works well. I've had this mix of
varieties in commercial Hazy IPAs, but not as many West Coast IPAs. This is definitely
a good mix and something I'd be interested in experimenting with more in the future.
