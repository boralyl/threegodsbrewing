There are several different methods in which coffee can be added to a beer. I’ve had
great success with two different methods: adding cold pressed coffee at bottling/kegging
and dry-hopping with whole coffee beans. It’s important to remember that not just any
coffee bean will work with your beer. Trying the base beer to get an idea of what
flavors and aromas it has, greatly helps in trying to find a coffee that will either
complement it or add enough contrast without being lopsided. I am only going to touch
on the methods I have tried. You could also try adding coffee during the boil or
during the mash, [among many other methods](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=adding+coffee+to+beer).

## Dry Hopping with Whole Coffee Beans

For my first coffee beer I followed a clone recipe of [Wake n Bake](https://www.terrapinbeer.com/beer/wake-n-bake) as explained by
Terrapin’s Spike Buckowski on [The Brewing Network](http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/post1862/). To make it even easier to clone,
Terrapin sells the exact Jittery Joe’s blend that they use in the beer right on
[their website](https://shop.terrapinbeer.com/products/jittery-joes-wake-n-bake-coffee-blend?_pos=1&_sid=6f7978048&_ss=r).

Beyond my normal sanitation practices, I didn’t do anything special to the beans. After
primary fermentation was complete I sanitized a 5 gallon glass carboy and added 3 ounces
of whole beans directly to the bottom of the carboy. I racked the beer on top of the beans,
threw an airlock on top and let it sit for 3 days. I read from several sources to basically
let the beer sit until it gets the flavor you want. Despite the short contact time, the
beer had a huge coffee aroma and flavor after it was bottled and conditioned. I recently
opened up the last bottle which was over a year old and to my surprise the beer still
packed the coffee punch.

I didn’t encounter any issues with head retention due to the oils of the beans, despite
various sources mentioning that this could happen. Overall I was very pleased with this
method, although at a large scale brewery, this would be an expensive and non-feasible
option. At the homebrew level it’s not really an issue.

## Cold-Pressing Coffee

It wasn’t until a month or so after I moved to Portland that I learned about the
[french press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press). This amazing device makes
exceptional coffee, I may never go back to my drip machine!

The idea of cold-pressing the coffee involves grinding the beans and using a 4:1 ratio of
water to ground coffee and instead of heating water up, you simply use cold water. It
takes a bit longer to extract all of the essential oils from the ground coffee, so
beforehand I sanatized my french press, added the ground coffee, added the water, stirred,
and put some plastic wrap over top. I then placed the french press in my refrigerator for
approximately 24 hours. Right before racking my oatmeal coffee stout into the keg I pressed
the grounds and poured off the coffee into the keg, racking the beer on top of it.

The flavor from cold-pressed coffee is even stronger then using beans for dry-hopping. I
used about 4 ounces of ground coffee in one batch and another 4 ounces of a different ground
coffee in a 2nd batch, splitting the 5 gallons in two. The coffee flavor and aroma was
very prevalent in the final product. If you don’t like your coffee strong, you may want
to dial back the amount of ground coffee used when doing this method.
