A 7.2% abv West Coast IPA with Citra, Mosaic, Mosaic Lupomax, and Riwaka Cryo hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/ah-blah-blah-wc-ipa/).

# Appearance

Pours a cloudly, pale yellow color. There is a little clarity, but the haze is still pretty prominent after 3 weeks in the keg. It produces an inch of sticky white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the inside of the glass.

# Aroma

The aroma is really bright and can be smelled from a mile away. I get lime, pineapple and a hint of berry.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Moderate in carbonation with a crisp and dry finish. Citrus and pineapple up front followed by lime through the finish. Has a fantastic moderate bitterness that leaves you wanting another sip.

# Impressions

This by far one of my favorite West Coast IPA batches I've produced. The aroma and flavor are almost exactly what I was hoping for. This is the first batch where I used the hop dropper and didn't introduce any O2 at all into the beer after fermentation started.

I attribute the haze to a few factors. First, I didn't use any clarifying agent in this batch. Second, I used a massive dry hop that is two times what I normally use. Despite cold crashing and dumping the trub/hops twice, it's still has a haze to it. If it stuck around long enough it would eventually clear up in the kegerator, but I don't expect I'll find that out.
