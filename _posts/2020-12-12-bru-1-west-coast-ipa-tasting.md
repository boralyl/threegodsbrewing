For this beer I wanted to experiment with the [BRU-1](https://www.johnihaas.com/bru-1/)
hop variety. I ordered a pound of pellets from [Yakima Valley Hops](https://yakimavalleyhops.com/products/bru-1-hop-pellets).
The main descriptor for this hop is pineapple. Some more generic descriptors are "green fruit",
"sweet fruit" and "green-grassy".

# Appearance

The beer has a fluffy white head that sticks around for some time leaving a good amount
of lacing on the glass. The color is a golden amber. It's clear but not completely so.
It's been kegged for about 2 weeks so I would expect it to clear up even more as time
goes on.

# Aroma

The nose isn't as expressive as I expected. I get some sweet fruit and a general green
smell. There may also be a hint of spices in the aroma as well.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer is light-medium in body with medium carbonation. There is quite a bit of sweet
pineapple up front, it's followed by the green character with some bitterness and a mild
lingering sweetness.

# BRU-1 Impressions

This is a pretty unique hop. It's sweet character is a little too much for a west coast
IPA, but I think it would work great in a New England IPA (and have used it in a
[recent batch](/recipes/long-winded-pineapple/)). I can see this hop pairing
well with a lot of the new school varieties.
