In this recipe I utilizted 2 newer hop varieties ([HBC 586](https://yakimavalleyhops.com/products/hbc-586-hop-pellets) and [McKenzie](https://yakimavalleyhops.com/products/mckenzie-hops)) while keeping
my normal malt bill for West Coast IPAs.

# Appearance

The beer pours about an inch of fluffy white foam that leaves gobs of lacing as it dies down.
It is crystal clear with a light straw color. There is an abundant amount of
carbonation visible.

# Aroma

The aroma consists of pine, diesel and a general round fruitiness. It's not super
expressive, but does open up a bit as it warms.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

There is a medium amount of carbonation. Pine and resin seem to dominate but there are
some brighter fruity flavors like citrus and grapefruit. It finishes with a moderate
bitterness mixed in with some almost lemon like flavor.

# Impressions

This beer turned out pretty good. It lands somewhere between a really dank IPA and a
very fruity IPA. The bitterness helps with drinkability while not being overbearing.
Looking forward to using more of both of these hops in the future.
