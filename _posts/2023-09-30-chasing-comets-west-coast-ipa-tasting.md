A West Coast IPA with Cryo Columbus, Simcoe and Cryo Citra.

# Appearance

Pours a thick white head with great retention.  The beer is a pale straw color and is nearly crystal clear. The clarity is somewhat surprising considering how fresh it is and that I didn't using any fining gelatin. It cleared up remakrably well in the unitank. There are some visible carbonation bubbles.

# Aroma

The aroma on this one is very strong and can be smelled before my nose gets close to the glass. I get mostly dank/catty notes along with citrus and a touch of pine.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Medium in carbonation and light in body.

As noted in the aroma, up front I get pine and dank notes. The citrus flavors hit near the finish and are swept away by a moderate bitterness that is somewhat dry.

# Impressions

This is only my second batch in the SS Brewtech Unitank and I'm happy with the results.  This new vessel has had a very steep learning curve, but each batch gets slightly easier and with fewer mistakes. The beer itself sits at a great ABV range for the style and has some classic west coast flavors.
