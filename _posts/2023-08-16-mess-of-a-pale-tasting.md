A West Coast IPA with Simcoe, Idaho 7, Mosaic and Chinook hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/mess-of-a-pale/).

# Appearance

Pours about an inch of fluffy white head. It sticks around for quite awhile leaving lacing
on the inside of the glass. The beer itself is nearly crystal clear with a light orange
hue. There is visible carbonation.

# Aroma

There is a touch of sweetness on the nose along with a beautiful blend of fruity characteristics.
I get lime, orange marmalade and some general citrus notes.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

The beer is crisp and light in body with medium carbonation. The taste has the fruit flavor
I picked up in the aroma, but also has a bit of pine which I didn't detect from the nose.
It finishes with a moderate bitterness that lingers.

# Impressions

Despite the many mistakes I made with this batch, it still produced beer! Not only did
I end up with beer, but it's actually pretty tasty. Due to many errors the ABV ended up
being 5.5%, so this is more of a pale ale hopped like an IPA. This was my first batch
using the SS Brewtech Unitank and it's clear I have a lot to learn. I made copious notes,
so I hope the next few batches will continue to improve and have fewer mistakes. Despite
my failures I'm pretty happy with this beer. The Idaho 7 hops are new to me and seem
to play pretty well with Simcoe.

My next IPA will likely switch up the hop pairing and see how Citra and Idaho 7 work
together.
