A New Zealand style Pilsner with Nelson Sauvin, Nectaron and Riwaka Cryo hops.

> Recipe for this post can be found [here](/recipes/kiwi-pils-v6/).

# Appearance

Pours crystal clear with an inch of white foam that has good retention.
There are visible carbonation bubbles and the beer has a light straw color.

# Aroma

The aroma can be smelled before the glass gets close to my mouth. It's a mix of white grape and lime.

# Taste/Mouthfeel

Medium - high carbonation. As detected in the aroma, it kicks off with the white grape, followed by a mix of lime and breadiness in the finish. It's crisp and extremely easy drinking.

# Impressions

For this version, I used 3oz of dry hops, 1oz of which was cryo. I think I could dial this up even more (say 4-5oz) and still get a refreshing pilsner without it being too over the top hoppy. Really pleased with how this batch turned out, it's perfect for summertime.
