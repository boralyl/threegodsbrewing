## Notes

- Began Brew day by running 3G of saniclean through the pump for 5 minutes.
- Milled the grain using the new Spike Mill at gap setting 34. Heated up the water to the strike temp of 157F after adding water agents/salts. Used the drill powered mash stirrer to stir up the mash. Rested at 152F For an hour. (2024-10-25)
- Post boil og Was 1.067. Added .42 gallons of water to bring it down to 1.062. (2024-10-25)
- Got 5 gallons at 1.064 into the fermenter. (2024-10-25)
- Dumped the trub (2024-10-27)
- Added dry hops. Am splitting the dosage between the end of fermentation (2oz Simicoe, 2oz Mosaic Lupomax, 1oz HBC-586 Lupomax) and at kegging. When kegging I"ll add the remaining 5oz of dry hops. (2024-10-28)
- Began cold crashing. Attached co2 and closed blow off valve. Set gauge to ~5psi (2024-10-30)
- Dumped the trub. Got the dry hops out without any clogging. (2024-10-31)
- Pushed 5g of sanitizer out of prepped keg. Quickly opened keg and added dry hops 2oz Simcoe, 2 Oz Lupomax Mosaic and 1oz Lupomax hbc 586. Also added 1/2 tsp dissolved gelatin in 1/4 cup h2o. Then purged keg with c02 three times. Twisted the transfer valve about 45 degrees up. Then began a closed transfer to the keg. (2024-11-02)
