## Notes

- Began brew day around 9am. Water and minerals were measured out the night before.

- Began with 2G saniclean running through the pump for 5 minutes. After pumping it out into a bucket, I added the water and heated it up to the strike temp.

- At strike, I added the grain stirred manually, then used the drill bit extension to ensure every part of the mash was stirred evenly with no dough balls. (2024-12-27)

- Stirred up the mash a bit with 10mins remaining. (2024-12-27)
- Collected 7G @ 1.055 pre boil (2024-12-27)
- Chilled down to 83f which collected 15 gals of water for cleaning. Then transferred to the unitank. (2024-12-27)
- Pitched the yeast and added 1 drop of ALDC. (2024-12-27)
- Dumped the trub (2024-12-29)
- Took another gravity reading, was approx the same as last reading, 1.010-1.011. (2025-01-02)
- Chilled to 64F then added the 6oz of dry hop through the top prv opening. (2025-01-02)
- Sanitized carb port and tubing and connected to tank. Closed blow off valve and set gauge to ~5psi before starting the cold crashing (2025-01-04)
- Dumped the trub and hops. Adjusted the racking arm to about 45 degrees to the side (2025-01-05)
- Dumped the trub and hops again. Started carbonation. Set gauge to 10psi. Will slowly increase over the morning until it gets to 20psi for burst carbonating (2025-01-06)
- Kegged, got about 4G.

This was not fun. I originally tried to keg this 4 days prior. However, I hooked things up wrong and the pressure in the unitank dropped. This caused trub and sediment to shoot back up in the tank. When I then tried to transfer everything got clogged and it was impossible to do the transfer (I tried over and over again for hours).

Ultimately I decided to let everything settle again before retrying. I waited 2.5 days with the tank at the cold crash temp. First I disassembled the liquid quick disconnect which was clogged. Then I followed all the instructions from this post https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/transfer-carbonated-beer-from-all-rounder-to-keg.682573/#post-8932151 very closely.

I have since updated my notes to include that process for next time. (2025-01-11)
