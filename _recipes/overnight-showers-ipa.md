## Notes

4/18/19

- Brewed at home. Beautiful warm and sunny day.
- Collected ~3G from first runnings, then just under 5 gallons after 1st sparge.
- Ended up with ~7.5G in the fermenter pre-boil.
- The gravity was low, so I boiled for 75 minutes.
- Ended up with ~4.7G in the fermenter at 1.060 which was lower then expected.
- Added the yeast to the beer at ~68F at 3pm.

4/24/19

- Gravity reading was 1.012, it's done at 6.3% abv.
- Really fruit forward!

5/25/19

- Added 2 oz Azacca and 1 oz Ekuanot (cryo) to keg when racking beer. Let sit in cooler for 20 minutes then added gelatin. Used 1/4 cup cold water and just over 1/2 teaspoon of the gelatin powder. Mixed it up then in 10s increments in the microwave heated up the mixture until the temp was about 145F. Then I added to the keg, sealed and purged 3 imes.
- Kegged in the afternoon. Set pressure to 30PSI around 6pm (for 24 hours) then turned down to normal 11PSI.
