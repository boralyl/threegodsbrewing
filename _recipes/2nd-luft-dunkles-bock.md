## Notes

11/19/22

- Started the brew day around 8am.
- Heated up mash-in water to 190F then put it in the mash tun to warm up while I had breakfast.
- After breakfast I added the grain and mixed it up until the temp was ~151F.
- Pre-boil gravity was 1.049 and collected 6.25G in the kettle. This is slightly under volume and estimated pre-boil gravity.
- Did some whirlpooling for about 20mins to collect the hop matter towards the center of the pot.
- Collected ~4.25G @ 1.065.
- Pitched yeast at around 5pm when the beer was ~64F
