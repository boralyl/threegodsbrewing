## Notes

- Started boil at 100% then dialed it down to 80% to get a good rolling boil. Extended boil to 75 minutes due to lower gravity. (2023-12-22)
- At 10 minutes left in the boil I tripped over the wire for the controller and it ripped the cord out and I could no longer control the unit. I quickly transfered the wort to my old kettle and brought it back up to a boil and added the 10 minute addition and restarted the timer. (2023-12-22)
- Took a gravity reading and it was around 1.011. Probably waited too long for spunding, but shut the blow-off valve anyway. (2023-12-25)
- With the blowoff valve closed, the pressure in the tank is now around 3PSI. (2023-12-26)
- Took another gravity reading and it's still sitting at ~1.011. The pressure inside has built up to ~5PSI.

I just realized I never dumped the trub within the first 48 hours, so it may be a little messy.

I also forgot to turn the racking valve in an upward position prior to spunding. (2023-12-27)

- Unitank now at 6psi. Will start cold crashing tomorrow (2023-12-28)
- Began cold crashing (2023-12-29)
- After just over 48 hours of cold crashing, I kegged the beer. I added the dry hops directly to the sanitized keg, then purged the head space. I then did a closed transfer from the unitank to the keg. The PSI in the unitank had gone done to ~1PSI during cold crashing. The transferred beer did not appear to be carbonated, so doing the slow carb method of keeping it connected at 12PSI for a week. (2024-01-01)
