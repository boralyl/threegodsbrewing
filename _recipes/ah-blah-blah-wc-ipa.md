## Notes

- Measured out the salts and the mash water the night before. Began brew day by adding 3G of saniclean and turned on the pump and opened the recirc and whirlpool valves for 5-10 mins. I then heated the water to the strike temp of 156F. I slowly added the grains and stirred and used the drill whisk to ensure there were no dough balls. Mash began around 8:30am. (2025-03-28)
- Added 1 dropper of ALDC, yeast and floating hydrometer at 65f (2025-03-28)
- Dumped the trub (2025-03-29)
- Added the dry hops. Closed the butterfly valve on top of the fermenter. Removed the safety PRV lid. Attached the sanitized sight glass on top. Attached the sanitaized lid on top. Connected the CO2 and set the PSI to ~7PSI. Pulled the PRV. Repeated this process 3x. Then removed the lid and added the 10oz of dry hops. Re-attached the lid and connected the C02 and set the PSI to ~7PSI. Once filled, pulled the PRV. Repeated this process 3x. ON the last time, I removed the CO2, and pulled the PRV again. I then opened the butterfly valve and the hops dropped into the fermenter. I closed the butterfly valve and removed the sight glass and re-attached the safety PRV lid. (2025-04-02)
- Dumped the trub one last time. Rotated the racking arm 45 degrees and started slowly increasing the pressure for burst carbonating. (2025-04-05)
- Kegged. The dry hops sucked up a lot of beer, ended up with 3.75G in the keg. The flow got stuck initially due to clogging. I had to disassemble the liquid QD and clean it out. Eventually got it going. (2025-04-06)
