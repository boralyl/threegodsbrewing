## Notes

9/29/22

- Milled grain on the low side of recommendation @33, range is 33-45.

10/1/22

- Started around 8am.
- Heater mash-in water to 200F then pumped to the mash tun before breakfast.
- After breakfast I added the grain and stirred until the temp was ~148F. Next time perhaps only pre-heat water to 190F as it took some time to get the temp down. Also adding cold water was much more effective than just stirring.
- Added my sparge water (just under 5G) to my other kettle and began heating with 20 mins left in the mash.
- Vourlaufed for ~10 mins while the water heated up.
- Mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle. Collected just under 3G.
- Re-arranged the hoses and connected the sparge head to the mash tun.
- Pumped the ~175F water at a slow rate through the sparge head. After all the water was moved I removed the sparge head.
- Re-arranged the hoses again and mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle.
- Collected just under 6.5G @ 1.058.

* Collected ~4.2G @ 1.060 post-boil.
* Chilled to ~70F and pitched the yeast in the evening.

10/7/22

- Took gravity reading was, 1.009. Going to let it sit for another 24hrs then cold crash it overnight and keg it on 10/9/22.

10/8/22

- Cold crashed.

10/9/22

- Kegged at ~60F.
- Racked on top of dry hops.

* Got ~3.75G in the keg.
* Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F and it was fully dissolved
* Added to keg then purged with co2 3 times.
* Set to 20PSI to burst carbonate for 24-48 hrs before setting back to serving pressure of ~13PSI.
