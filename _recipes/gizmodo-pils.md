## Notes

2/20/23

- Began brew day around 9am. Heated up the mash water (~3.25G) of to ~185F then transferred to the mash tun using the pump.
- Let sit for about 20 minutes before stirring in the grain.
- Added the grain then stirred until it reached ~149F then let sit for 1 hour.
- IN the last 5 minutes of the mash, I started vorlaufing. I ran for a total of about 10 mins while the sparge water heated up to 170F.
- Mashed out just under 2 gallons from the initial runnings.
- Switched the hoses and ran the sparge water into the mash tun. Gave it a quick stir then began mashing out.
- Collected just over 7.25G with the pre-boil gravity at ~1.035. It was slightly under, so decided to go with a 75min boil.
- Chilled to 67F, got 4.5G at 1.043 for the OG (target was 1.048)
- Put in the fermentation chamber at 67F and pitched the yeast with the fan turned on to bring down the temp.

2/27/23

- Took a gravity reading, finished at 1.006.
- Started cold crashing over night to keg the next day.
  2/28/23

- Chilled to ~52F overnight.
- Added dry hops to sanitized keg then racked the beer on top. Got about 4.3G.
- Purged with co2 3 times.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F and it was fully dissolved
- Added to keg then purged with co2 3 times.
- Set to 20PSI to burst carbonate for 24 hours, then will dial down to serving pressure, ~12psi.
