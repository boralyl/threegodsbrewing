## Notes

10/16/21

First time using the blichmann pump, SS Brewtech Mash Tun and new SS Brewtech Brewmasters Edt Kettle.

Made quite a few mistakes here.

- Need to run some tests and determine how much heat is loss / padding that I need when adding the strike water to the mash tun. It ended up closer to 130F instead of 152F. Should probably use a calculator to take into account the mash tun, temp of grain, etc.
- Wasn't able to use the pump at all during the brew day for transferring water/wort or recirculating/sparging and whirlpooling. This was due to a dumb mistake a of mistakening the out port for the IN port. I tested it at the end of the brew day hooked up properly and it worked as expected.
- NOTE: You can turn the racking arm, but it's manual. YOu need to slightly loosen the tri clamp then turn the entire ball valve, then re-tightening the tri-clamp.
- Got 7.5G pre-boil @ 1.035
- Ended up in the fermenter with ~5G @ 1.044. Gravity was low, and I didn't realize how much deadspace there was, may need to adjust beersmith. I also used .25G less than asked for during sparging for no good reason. Favor more wort to less wort.
- Pitched yeast at 6:30pm when the wort was around 69F.

10/24/21

- Took a gravity reading and it has reached 1.010 (maybe slightly under that at 1.009).
- Started cold-crashing at 3pm when the beer was at 64F.
- Kegged in the evening around 730 with the temperature at 61F.
- Got 4.5-4.75G.
- Purged with CO2 x3
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then pured with co2 3 times.
- Hooked up to CO2 @ 35 PSI for 24 hours for bust carbonating. Will dial it down to ~12 PSI (serving) tomorrow.
- Note for next time: When grabbing a sample or kegging, just rotate the nozzle at the bottom 45 degrees (or a touch more) to get clear beer and avoid getting yeast/trub into your sampling glass / keg.

10/25/21

- Around 5pm, released pressure on the keg, and dialed it badk down to serving, ~12PSI.
