## Notes

- Milled using the new Spike Mill at gap setting ~34 (2024-07-13)
- Hit strike temp of 155, added grains and stirred. Added a little at a time, stirred and added more until all the grain was in. Turned on the pump and began recirculating before starting the mash timer. (2024-07-13)
- Stirred once more while mashing around 15 mins left. (2024-07-13)
- Added 15 minutes to the boil since the gravity was low and I had a extra wort (2024-07-13)
- Dumped the trub (2024-07-15)
- Visible fermenting has settled down considerably. Went ahead and added the 3oz of dry hops through the 3" TC port. (2024-07-16)
- Started cold crashing. Put about 5psi into the fermenter and closed the blow off valve. (2024-07-19)
- Dumped the trub and hops. (2024-07-20)
- Flushed star San out of keg into a bucket. Added 1tsp gelatin to mixed warm water, 1/4 cup. Added to keg along with 2nd round of dry hops. Sealed keg then purged of air. Began then to transfer from the unitank to the keg. Beer was not carbonated so I could do the 2nd dry hop. Also allowed me to use gelatin. (2024-07-21)
