## Notes

11/14/20

- First runnings 3.6g
  `1st batch 2g` 2nd batch 2g
  ` Put 7.75 g in the kettle
- I think the reason I am missing my numbers is that the thermometer I am using is off (or the thermomter on the kettle). The difference is about 10F where the kettle showed 190 and the thermomter showed 180F. I did verify that boil started at the expected temp on the kettle, and the thermometer was about 12F lower. Time to get a new one!
- Going to boil for 75 min since I have extra volume.
- pre-boil was 1.053
- Ended up with ~5.5G @ 1.067 in the fermenter. Pitched yeast around 3pm.

11/19/20

- Took gravity reading and was at 1.010.

11/22/20

- Chilled to 57F the night before.
- Still finished at 1.010
- Racked on top of dry hops. Got about 5G.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then pured with co2 3 times.
- Did burst carbonation, setting it to ~30PSI around 2pm. Will let sit for 24 hours then dial it back down to ~12psi.
