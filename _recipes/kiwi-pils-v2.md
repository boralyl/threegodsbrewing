## Notes

3/22/2020

- Brewed at home.
- Collected 2G from first runnings
- Collected 3.9G after first sparge.
- Ended up with 6.5G pre-boil at 1.037.
- I accidentally only did 4G sparge, it should have been 5.5G, Missed the split batch sparge!
- Ended up with 4.5G at 1.050. Chilled to 59F then pitched the yeast.

3/27/20

- Took a gravity reading and it was ~1.009

3/29/20

- Chilled to 52F the night before.
- Racked on top of dry hops. Got about 4G, this was expected since I goofed up the batch sparge.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then pured with co2 3 times.
- Finally set keg in kegerator and hooked it up to CO2 at serving pressure (~12PSI)
- Will check in a week.
