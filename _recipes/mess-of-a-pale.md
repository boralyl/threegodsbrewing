| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Mash In | Add 4.5 gal (17 L) of water at 164.5&deg;F (73.6&deg;C) | 152.0&deg;F (66.666667&deg;C) | 60 mins   |

## Notes

- Accidentally read the labels wrong and added 1G short of what I needed for the mash. Ended up with ~7G @1.046. Added 1G of water and will extend the boil to account for gravity. (2023-07-16)
- Dumped the trub now that fermentation is active. Forgot to remove blow off tube from arm before dumping so may have sucked in some sanitizer. (2023-07-17)
- Began cold crashing. Connected co2 to carb stone with about 3psi of pressure to prevent a vacuum. Blow off still open and attached to tube. (2023-07-21)
- Dumped the trub/yeast after ~48hrs of cold crashing. Then set the CO2 to 20psi connected to the carb stone. Forgot to adjust the racking arm in a more upward direction before turning on CO2. I then decided to not burst carb and drop it down to ~15psi (2023-07-23)
- Transferred the carbed beer to a keg that had the 4oz of dry hops inside it. Then put it in the kegerator at 12 PSI. (2023-07-24)
