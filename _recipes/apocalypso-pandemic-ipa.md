## Notes

4/4/2020

- Started the brew day during (shelter in place!) at 11am at home.
- My mash temperature was a little too low (142 instead of 149F) but I went with it.
- Pre-boil gravity was 1.045, which was much lower than 1.060 target.
- Collected 7.5G @1.045 and did an 80 min boil to increase the OG.
- Added 5.5G @ 1.060 to the fermenter around 3pm.

4/10/2020

- Took hydrometer sample, FG is 1.010 so 6.6%abv.

4/11/2020

- Chilled to 56F the night before.
- Racked on top of dry hops. Got about 5G.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then pured with co2 3 times.
- Finally set keg in kegerator and hooked it up to CO2 at serving pressure (~12PSI)
- Will check in a week.
