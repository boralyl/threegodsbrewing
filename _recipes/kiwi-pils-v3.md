## Notes

6/14/21

- Brewed at home. Pre-heated water to almost 180F according to the kettle, but the digital reader said it was 169F.
- Added grain to water after a 10 minute rest and hit 151F.
- Got 7.5G @ 1.033 (target pre-boil was 1.040) so I did a 75m boil.
- Added 0.5oz Nelson at 60min
- Ended up with 5.25G @ 1.044
- Added yeast at around 68F and turned on the fan at 245pm.
- Fermented warm.

6/21/21

- Took a hydrometer sample and it finished at 1.004 at ~5.5% abv.

6/22/21

- Began cold crashing.

6/23/21

- Pulled fermenter out of the chamber at 59F.
- Added 1 oz Motueka and 0.5 oz Nelson Sauvin into the bottom of a sanatized keg then racked the beer on top using the clear tube connected to the out port since this lager didn't have many hops.
- Got about 5G.
- Purged with CO2 x3
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water.  Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then pured with co2 3 times.
- Hooked up to CO2 @ 35PSI at 4pm for 24hrs.
