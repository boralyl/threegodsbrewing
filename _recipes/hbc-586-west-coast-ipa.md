## Notes

4/3/22

- Began brew day around 8am. Heated up ~4.5G of water to ~200F then transferred to the mash tun using the pump.
- Temp became around 175F after transfer. Let sit in the mash tun while I had breakfast.
- Added the grain with the water around 163F and stirred until it got to about 150F then let it in the mash tun for 1 hour.
- Added my sparge water (just under 5G) to my other kettle and began heating with 20 mins left in the mash.
- Vourlaufed for ~10 mins while the water heated up.
- Mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle. Collected just under 3G.
- Re-arranged the hoses and connected the sparge head to the mash tun.
- Pumped the ~170F water at a slow rate through the sparge head. After all the water was moved I removed the sparge head and stirred gently.
- Re-arranged the hoses again and mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle.
- Collected just under 8G @ 1.048. This was slightly under, so I am going to boil for an extra 15 minutes.
- Turned off heat and added whirlpool hops after starting the whirlpool (forgot to let it cool to 190F). Whirlpooled for 20 minutes.
- Chilled to 68F then pumped it into the sanitized fermenter.
- Ended up with ~4.6G @ 1.060. This is low, but better than last brew.

4/6/22

- Took gravity reading as it looked mostly done and it was 1.012. Going to let it sit until Saturday then keg to clean up any fermentation byproducts.

4/9/22

- Kegging day, hydrometer reading is 1.011

* Racked on top of dry hops. Got about 4.2G.
* Purged with co2 3 times.
* Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F and it was fully dissolved
* Added to keg then purged with co2 3 times.

- Set to 20PSI to burst carbonate for 24 hours, then will dial down to serving pressure, ~12psi
