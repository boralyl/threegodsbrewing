## Notes

- Added 185f water to mash tun to pre heat for 10 minutes before adding the grain (2023-05-28)
- Began vorlaufing as sparge water is heating up (2023-05-28)
- Got 2g from mash out (2023-05-28)
- Gravity came in a little low, so I'm going to extend the boil to 75 min (2023-05-28)
- Took gravity reading and it mostly matched the ispindel of 1.006 (iSpindel was showing 1.005). Am going to bring the temp up a bit for 24 hours to finish off the beer than cold crash and keg it in the next 24-48 hrs. (2023-06-03)
- Began cold crashing (2023-06-04)
- Kegged and set psi to 30 psi for just over 24 hrs to burst carbonate (2023-06-05)
