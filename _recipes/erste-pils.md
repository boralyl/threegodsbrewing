## Notes

1/27/19

- Took a hydrometer sample. Beer is at 62F. Final Gravity is 1.007.

1/29/19

- Racked beer to keg. Attached 3/8 in tubing to the brew bucket and opened the nozzle into a sanitized keg. It was super easy.
- Let keg in the keezer for 3+ hours to chill it down before adding gelatin for clearing it up.
- Added 1tsp gelatin to 1 cup cold water. Let sit and bloom for 25 minutes. Put in microwave for 15 second intervals and took temperature. Kept going about 4-5 times until the mixture cleared up and the temperature was around 155F. Then opened keg and dumped it in. Jostled it a little then purged headspace with co2 about 4-5 times.
- Turned off gas to other 3 kegs and turned on to the pils keg. Cranked up PSI to 30 around 11pm. Will let it sit for ~24 hours before dialing it back down.
