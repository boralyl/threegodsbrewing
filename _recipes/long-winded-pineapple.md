- Brewed at home in the garage.
- Bumped up the specs a bit since I got more grain than I needed from the homebrew shop.
- Only had 1 ounce of El Dorado left, so I subbed out the 2oz whirlpool addition with Nelson Sauvin which I had on hand. Will have to use something else for the dry hop.
- Got 2.5G fist runnings then 7.5G pre-boil at 1.044 which is well below the target pre-boil.
- Decided to do a 75 minute boil to possibley improve the gravity.
- Ended up with 5.3G @ 1.058 which is still way under the target :(

- Took a gravity reading and it was 1.012.
- Started chilling it for kegging tomorrow, Thrus, 9/3/2020
