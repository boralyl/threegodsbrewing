## Notes

7/31/21

- Ended up with 8G @ 1.044 pre-boil. Target was 1.053, so am going to do a 75 min boil.
- Let it cool naturally till about 200F. Then began stirring to create a whirlpool and added the hops. Manually continued stirring for 6 minutes to try get a good whirlpool and center the trub.
- Let sit for another 10 minutes then begain chilling.
- O.G. is 1.056, had just under 6 gallons post-boil, so lost about 2G to boil off.
- Ended up with 5.25G in the fermenter. Chilled to 68F then pitched yeast.

8/7/21

- Took a hydrometer sample, FG is 1.009.

8/8/21

- Racked on top of dry hops. Got about 5G.
- Purged with co2 3 times.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F.
- Added to keg then purged with co2 3 times.
- Finally set keg in kegerator and hooked it up to CO2 at ~36PSI for 24 hours to burst carbonate.
