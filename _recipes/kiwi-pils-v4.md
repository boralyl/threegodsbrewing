## Notes

7/17/22

- Began brew day around 10am. Heated up the mash water (~3.25G) of to ~200F then transferred to the mash tun using the pump.
- Temp became around 175F after transfer. Let sit in the mash tun while I had breakfast.
- Added the grain with the water around 163F and stirred until it got to about 150F then let it in the mash tun for 1 hour.
- Added my sparge water (just over 5G) to my other kettle and began heating with 20 mins left in the mash.
- Vourlaufed for ~10 mins while the water heated up.
- Mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle. Collected just under 3G.
- Re-arranged the hoses and connected the sparge head to the mash tun. I couldn't get it to pump, so I ended up manually dumping the ~5G into the mash tun.
- Stirred gently.
- Re-arranged the hoses again and mashed out through the pump to the brew kettle.

* Collected 7.75G @ 1.036. Going to boil for 15 longer (75) since I have the extra volume to hopefully bring up the OG.
* Added 5.5G to the fermenter at 1.045, slightly low, but not terrible.
* Pitched yeast at ~74F in the fermentation chamber.

7/24/22

- Took FG reading of ~1.010
- Transferred ~4.7G to the keg.
- Purged with co2 3 times.

7/25/22

- I had ran out of gelatin so added the next day.
- Added 1 tsp of gelatin to 1/4 cup of cold water. Stirred and heated in 10s increments until the temp was about 145F and it was fully dissolved
- Added to keg then purged with co2 3 times.
- Set to serving pressure, ~13PSI to carbonate.
