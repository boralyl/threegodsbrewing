## Notes

* Began Brew day by recirculation of sani clean through the pump. I had measured out the grain, water and salts the night before. (2025-05-09)
* Slowly added and stirred the milled grain to the 154F water then set the temp to 149F. Used the drill and mash stirrer attachment to get it nice and stirred with no dough balls. (2025-05-09)
* Ended up with 6.7G @1.045. Using the calculator I needed to add 1G of water to lower the pre boil gravity to 1.039 (2025-05-09)
* Pitched the yeast, added ALDC and dropped in the floating hydrometer (2025-05-09)
* Dumped the trub (2025-05-11)
* Dumped the trub a second time (2025-05-12)
* Added the dry hops using the dry hopper.  With top valve closed, removed PRV. Attached sanitized sight glass. Attached PRV with gas connect to the top and purged O2 3x. Opened and added 3 oz dry hops. Re-attached PRV with gas connect and purged CO2 3x. After the last purge, I disconnected the CO2 then opened the valve to drop the hops. Afterwards, I closed the valve, re-assembled the factory PRV and re-opened the valve. (2025-05-16)
* Pulled a sample after dry hopping for 36 hours. Was 1.009. Starting to cold crash and will dump the trub/hops tomorrow AM. (2025-05-17)
* Dumped the trub/yeast/hops (2025-05-18)
* Followed the steps in the docs to keg.  Prior to the closed transfer, I also did a closed transfer of the 1tbsp Silafine to the keg after emptying the starsan into a bucket.  Then I did a transfer to the keg without any issues. (2025-05-22)
