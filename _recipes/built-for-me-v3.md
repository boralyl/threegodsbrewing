## Mash

**Mash Schedule**: High fermentability

| Name    | Description                                             | Step Temperature       | Step Time |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| Mash In | Add 8.1 gal (30 L) of water at 155.8&deg;F (68.8&deg;C) | 149.0&deg;F (65&deg;C) | 60 mins   |
| Sparge  | Add 0.0 gal (0L) water at 169&deg;F (75&deg;C)          | -                      | -         |

## Notes

- Poured grain in slow and stirred after each amount was added. Did this about 5 times until all the grain was added. At 30 minutes into the mash I gave it a stir. (2024-01-27)
- Collected 6.9g pre boil. The gravity was low, 1.045. I believe this was due to ordering online and the supplier not double milling the grain as specified in the notes. Next time I'll have to just go in to the shop to do it myself. Going to extend the boil to 75 minutes to try to increase the gravity. (2024-01-27)
- Chilled to 170 then added in whirlpool hops and began the whirlpool for 20 minutes (2024-01-27)
- Dumped the trub (2024-01-28)
- Added the 4oz of dry hops through the 3in opening at the top after taking a gravity reading showing that it was just a few points away from finishing. (2024-01-30)
- Closed blow off valve and hooked up co2 to the carb stone with 2psi, then began cold crashing (2024-02-02)
- Dumped the trub and hops (2024-02-04)
- Kegged the beer, got around 4G. Realized I forgot to adjust the valve to point up after dumping the trub after cold crashing. Still looked pretty clear. (2024-02-05)
